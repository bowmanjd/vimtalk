And miles to go before I sleep.


He will not see me stopping here
The woods are lovely, dark and deep.
Between the woods and frozen lake
To ask if there is some mistake.
Whose woods these are I think I know.
But I have promises to keep,
My little horse must think it queer

Of easy wind and downy flake.
The only other sound's the sweep

He gives his harness bells a shake
And miles to go before I sleep,
The darkest evening of the year.
by Robert Frost 
His house is in the village though;
To watch his woods fill up with snow.
To stop without a farmhouse near
Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening
